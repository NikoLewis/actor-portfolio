### Project Inspo

This is the first thing I've coded in 3 years and I really loved how much I was forced to stretch my UX skills to complete this project. I went into this wanting a portfolio that I could feel confident sharing. My design inspiration attempted to capture a cozy and thoughtful sort of playful to reflect my personality.

### Design Goals and Bio inspo
